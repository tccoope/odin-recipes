# odin-recipes
This repository contains the code I've created for The Oden Project's assignment of creating a recipe web site. 

### Goals
My goals for undertaking this project are twofold

**Professional Goals**
1. I have always been interested in software engineering and development and with most applications these days being web applications, it seems like the right place to put my development focus now that I am taking the time to learn more.
2. As a Security Professional in the day job that is always interested in expanding my scope of knowledge, I would also like to learn more about web application security controls and testing.

**Personal Goals**
1. Build a meal planning web application for my family to use
2. Build a family web site to host pictures of the family and to get that information off of social media and stop using as many major services
3. As part of the Cloud Resume Challenge section on building a cloud resume, I want to build a portfolio site that goes well beyond a simple resume.

### Skills
I have been tinkering with HTML since the early days of the internet (first web page was probably built in 1995 or so), so early on I don't expect to gain new skills but to maintain and refresh old ones. Long term skills I hope to acquire through my web devlopment exloration may include:

1. Better knowledge of JavaScript and the associated vulnerabilities, particularly those related to insecure coding rather than JavaScript language vulns.
2. Better understanding of the use of APIs on both the front and back end of web applications
3. Exposure to REST, SOAP, and GraphQL APIs

    <h2>What are Fried Green Tomatoes?</h2>
    <p>Southern-style fried green tomatoes are the crisp, tangy, and boldly savory appetizer you should be making all year. This classic, down-home dish features sliced unripe tomatoes that are dredged in flour and cornmeal before being skillet-fried to buttery-brown perfection.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large green tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

        <li>Slice tomatoes 1/2 inch thick. Discard the ends.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs and milk together in a medium-sized bowl. Scoop flour onto a plate. Mix cornmeal, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper on another plate. Dip tomatoes into flour to coat. Then dip tomatoes into milk and egg mixture; dredge in breadcrumbs to completely coat.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place tomatoes in hot oil in batches of 4 or 5, to prevent them from touching; fry until crisp and golden brown on one side, then flip and fry on other side.</li>
        <li>Transfer fried tomatoes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining tomatoes.</li>
